<h2>The End of Twitter's Streaming API and Block Together changes</h2>

<em>2018-06-24 by Jacob Hoffman-Andrews</em>
<p/>

<p>
Twitter is <a
href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2018/enabling-all-developers-to-build-on-the-account-activity-api.html">ending
the User Streams API</a> in August. As a result, Block
Together's auto-block features are going away, effective today. I recommend <a
href="https://twitter.com/settings/notifications_timeline">Twitter's
notification settings</a> as a replacement. Relatedly, Block Together will be slower
to update shared block lists now.
</p>
<p>
Block Together relied on the User Streams API for three things:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Auto-blocking new accounts and accounts with low followers
 <li>Knowing when you unblock someone, to exempt them from future blocks
 <li>Knowing when to update your list of blocks
</ul>

<p>
Twitter's replacement for User Streams is the <a
href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2018/enabling-all-developers-to-build-on-the-account-activity-api.html">Account
Activity API</a>. Unfortunately, while User Streams was free, the Account Activity API is
only free up to 15 accounts. From 16 to 250 accounts is "Premium," and 251+
accounts is "Enterprise" pricing. In the tech world, enterprise pricing is
code for "if you have to ask, you can't afford it." Block Together has 59,000
users right now.
</p>

<p>
I've gotten a lot of suggestions to crowd-fund Block Together through Patreon. I
really appreciate all of you supporters out there who are willing to contribute!
My current feeling is that there is no way I could raise enough money through
Patreon to pay enterprise-level prices. I might do some crowdfunding in the
future to pay for server costs, however.
</p>

<p>
The good news: after Block Together launched in 2014, Twitter natively
implemented features pretty similar to Block Together's auto-block features. You
can now mute notifications based on a variety of things, including "new
accounts," and "Quality Filter." These are less transparent than Block
Together's auto-block features; Twitter won't tell you how new a "new account"
has to be to be muted, nor what specific content will get removed by "Quality
Filter." Also, the Twitter-native features act as mutes, not blocks. This means
you're less likely to hear about false positives, like a friend showing up with a
new account and trying to talk to you. On the flip side, muting may wind up
avoiding the tendency of determined trolls to escalate conflict when blocked.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, the Twitter-native notification settings make a decent replacement
for Block Together's auto-block features, and I recommend that most Block
Together users <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/notifications_timeline">enable them</a>.
</p>

<h2>The Future of Block Lists</h2>

<p>
Block lists will stick around but will be a bit slower. Without the User Streams API, Block Together
won't find out immediately when you block someone new, so your block list will
not get updated immediately. Instead, a once-a-day task will update your block
list. You can also trigger an earlier update by visiting <a
href="https://blocktogether.org/my-blocks">your personal blocks page</a>. Note
that the latter may not update right away if your block list is
large.
</p>

<p>
In the next couple of months, I may redesign how block lists are
updated. Right now your block list is exactly who you block. The goal
of this approach was to make it easy to add people to your list, simply
by blocking them in the Twitter UI. But real-world experience has shown
that the most effective block lists use a dedicated account,
not one that anyone uses for their regular Twitter reading. And often
these lists have more than one maintainer. So updating block lists
based on a specific Twitter account's blocks may not be as useful as I
originally thought. And it's relatively complex for Block Together to keep
track of blocks added and removed that way.
</p>

<p>
The main design I am considering would be that your Block Together list is
separate from who you block on Twitter. It would start out empty, and you could
add and remove accounts through the Block Together web site. I am also considering alternate
ways to add blocks, by sharing a tweet via DM to @blocktogether (which can be
done in the Twitter UI), or via API or a browser extension.
I'm interested in feedback here, especially from people who run block lists:
What would be the most convenient way for you to go from seeing a tweet to
adding an account to a shared block list?
</p>

<p>
These alternate designs could both reduce server costs and make Block Together
easier to maintain.
</p>

<h2>Unblocks</h2>

<p>
As part of the User Streams changes, Block Together will no longer find
out immediately about unblocks. Since the main purpose of finding out
about unblocks was to prevent the auto-block features from re-blocking
someone constantly, this shouldn't matter in most cases.
</p>

<h2>List size</h2>

<p>
Block lists are limited to 250,000 blocks. It has been the case for some time
now that you can't subscribe to a list that has more than 250,000 blocks, but
the limit will now be applied more broadly. Block Together won't update or display
lists with more than 250,000 blocks. It also won't offer them for download via
CSV or distribute blocks to subscribers.
</p>

<p>
I've found that Block Together's resource usage is dominated by extremely large
block lists with zero, or few, subscribers. These changes are a way to ensure that
resource usage is more fairly spread among all of Block Together's users. It
also makes a number of engineering choices significantly simpler to assume a
maximum block list size.

<p>
Thanks for reading, and may your mentions not be garbage.
