<h1>Use Cases</h1>

<p>These are a set of possible use cases for Block Together that help motivate and
reason about changes and new features. They are by no means exhaustive, and it
will be useful to add new cases.</p>

<p>Pat has a stalker who persistently creates new accounts and @-mentions Pat. Pat
blocks the new accounts, but the stalker creates more new ones.</p>

<p>Tracy and Jamie write frequently about controversial topics and are often
attacked by a large community of people who wish to see them stop writing.
The attacker community changes over time but if someone attacks Tracy, they
are likely to attack Jamie as well.</p>

<p>Jordan is currently the subject of a temporary pileon. Many users from across
Twitter are suddenly attacking Jordan with @-mentions. The attacking mentions are
preventing Jordan from seeing friendly mentions, and Jordan is being driven off
Twitter by the abuse. Jordan has a community that would like to help mitigate the
attack.</p>
